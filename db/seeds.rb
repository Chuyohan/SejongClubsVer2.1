# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)


#categories = ["연극","종교","체육","컴공"]

#categories.each do |category|
#  0.upto(1) do |i|
#  c.name = "미정"
#    c.category = category
#    c.save
#  end
